# production-management-system-
This project was completed for the Internet Technologies course and is a web application designed to simplify the production management of a beverage company. The application focuses on database handling and provides two separate views for managers and employees. Managers can view and retrieve daily and monthly production reports based on the type of product. On the other hand, employees can add, delete, and update records related to production. Each user has their own credentials to use the system, and managers can have snapshots of employee logins.
